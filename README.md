![](./Ctrials_app_banner.png)

## Description

This is a web application that allows users to gather specific information about National Cancer Institute supported clinical trials. Users will be able to look at information regarding clinical trials, based on diffferent parameters, such as : disease, disease progression, interventions, age of study participant, and location of clinical trials. The Ctrials application takes it a step further, by allowing users to see clinical trials that are conducted nearby, in the context of an interative Google map. It has desktop, mobile, and tablet responsive capabilities.

### - Second Page of the application will provide further search breakdown.
-     User will be able to narrow down search results by different types of clinical trials by checking off and selecting all the different trial types to include.
-     User will have the choice to further narrow down results based on geolocation of the clinical trials, by selecting a country (from a dropdown menu), US state (from a dropdown menu), or actively inputing into a search bar for cities (needed for locations outside the United States). The user will also be able to input a desired distance away from their given location, to look for clinical trials. 
-     The results yeilded from based search will then be shown on Google Map with markers symbolozing each clinical trial in its location, near the user's given location. A list of the clinical trials shown on the map will be displayed below the map, with buttons that allow the user to click individual trials for further information.
